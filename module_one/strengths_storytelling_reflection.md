Strengths & Storytelling Reflection Guidelines

Build on your professional story by thinking about how you're progressing at Turing. Answer the questions below in your own gist to use your StrengthsFinder themes to add to your story:

Write 1-2 paragraphs about your StrengthsFinder themes: How have you seen yourself using these strengths at Turing? Has your understanding of these strengths changed since you first reflected on them? If so, how?

At Turing, things rarely go as planned. You receive a project from your instructors, expect it to go one way and you end up going somewhere completely different. Being adaptable is a must. WHen working on a project, I've had to change plans on the fly, delete lines and lines of code and be able to accept that thing aren't going to go the way I originally thought they did, and do so without so much as a second thought. Also, I've had to adapt to different people's pair styles. Partnering with other people can be very difficult, especially when the person appoaches a problem differently than you do. I think being adaptable has helped me look at things from other people's points of view and try to learn from their approach.
  My context strength has helped me look back at past lessons and projects and apply their teachings to current problems. As projects get more and more complicated, it helps me to look back at simple examples we were given in class to understand the new problem at hand.

Write a story about your Turing experience so far: When have you struggled? How have you dealt with struggle? When have you succeeded at Turing? How did you accomplish those successes?
  
  Currently, I'm struggling with out idea box project. For me it's difficult, because my partner doesn't bring the same level of intensity or consistency to the project as I do. Right now I'm learning how to motive him and express my grievences without being combative. Taking a step back from the problem and doing something else has really helped and reaching out for support from other students.
NumberGuesser was a big success for me. Doing it on my own was very difficult especially when I enjoy working with other people.
  
Answer the question: how does your Turing story end? Create a vision for your future and your career transition into being a junior developer.



After you practice storytelling in the session, answer this question: What was particularly easy or difficult about telling your story? What are 1-2 steps that you can take to continue to improve your abilities to tell your story, talk about yourself with ease, and examine your strengths?

I find it easy to talk about how I ended up at Turing and why I love it so much. I need to work on incorperating my strengths more and figuring out what I want my future to look like.
